# Magic Dates - Asp.Net WindowsForm App.
How to use date time in a C# application demonstrate how to get the day, month and year from a dateTime value in C#.  Example code shows how to split the month day and year values from a datetime variable and compare them to determine whether or not a date is "magic".  A magic number is where the day and month values added together equal the last two digits of the year.  For example, March 18, 2021 is magic because 3 + 18 = 21.  Other magic dates include April 17, 2021, May 16, 2021, June 15, 2021, July 14, 2021 etc.
